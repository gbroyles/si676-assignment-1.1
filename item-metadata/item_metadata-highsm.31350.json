In 1845 the International Order of Odd Fellows added the second story in exchange for a 999-year lease. After the town market closed in 1854, the town enclosed the stalls with brick exterior walls, and the building became a firehouse. In 1926, the Shepherdstown Women's Club obtained permission to use the building as a library, sharing the premises for some years with the town jail. The Shepherdstown Library, Inc. had the Odd Fellows' 999 year lease voided in 1962. A unique characteristic of the building remains the Odd Fellows' symbol of the Seeing Eye, peering at passersby from a semi-circular niche above the front door. Some say the eye moves.", "label": null}, {"note": "Credit line: West Virginia Collection within the Carol M.
